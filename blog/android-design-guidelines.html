Tablets, phones, glasses and many other devices run Android OS. With such a great variety of screen sizes, resources and style guides designing for Android can be intimidating for a designer and a lot of resources are outdated. </p><p>Material Design brings consistency to Android design language. Below guideliens are meant to help a mobile designer to get familiar with common concepts and design patterns for Android.</p><p class="footnote-small">The guide isn't meant to replace the official documentation by Google but rather help understand basic principles of designing for Android platform. Published: Nov 8, 2015.</p><h2>Why is this important?</h2><p>By following established patterns of the Android platform you can make the user feel comfortable using your app and the experience feel intuitive. It's User Experience Design, in a nutshell.</p><h2>Units and measurements</h2><div class="article-image"><img src="/images/blog/android-design-guidelines/24.png"></div><p>Android runs on variety of devices with different resolutions. Because of many different screen sizes and resolutions, Android based operation system support a notion of Density-independent pixel (dp). Although the concept of density independent pixel has been around for a while there's still a lot of confusion around the difference between pixels, points and densities. Before we move forward let's make sure we have the perfect understanding of these terms.</p><h3>Resolution, screen size and DPI explained</h3><p> <span class="accent">Resolution </span>is the total number of physical pixels on a screen. Measured in <span class="smallnote">pixels.</span></p><p> <span class="accent">Screen size </span>is physical size of the screen. Measured in <span class="smallnote">inches. </span>Grouped into 4 categories: small, normal, large, and extra-large.</p><p><span class="accent">Screen density </span>is the amount of pixels on the screen within one inch. Measured in <span class="smallnote">dpi (dots per inch) </span>- number of dots (units) per screen inch. Grouped into six generalized densities: low, medium, high, extra-high, extra-extra-high, and extra-extra-extra-high.</p><div class="article-image"><img src="/images/blog/android-design-guidelines/6.png"></div><p>DPI is an equivalent of one physical pixel on a 160 dpi screen. The conversion of dp units to screen pixels is simple: px = dp * (dpi / 160).</p><table class="resolutions"><tr class="tbl-header left"><td class="device">Density bucket</td><td>Scaling factor</td><td>Density</td></tr><tr class="left"><td> <span class="type">MDPI</span></td><td>1x</td><td>160dpi</td></tr><tr class="left"><td> <span class="type">HDPI</span></td><td>1.5x</td><td>240dpi</td></tr><tr class="left"><td> <span class="type">XHDPI</span></td><td>2x</td><td>360dpi</td></tr><tr class="left"><td> <span class="type">XXHDPI</span></td><td>3x</td><td>480dpi</td></tr><tr class="left"><td> <span class="type">XXXHDPI</span></td><td>4x</td><td>640dpi</td></tr></table><p>The generalized sizes and densities are arranged around a baseline configuration that is a normal size and mdpi (medium) density.</p><h3>What does it mean for my design?</h3><p>As you can see it's a good practice to start designing in @1x (scale factor 1) as a base line. Having more real estate on the screen can give application certain benefits but we'll talk about this in details below.</p><h2>Adaptive design</h2><div class="article-image"><img src="/images/blog/android-design-guidelines/adaptive.gif"></div><p>It might look complicated at first but all you really need to do is to understand the basic concepts of adaptive design for mobile devices. The concept is similar to responsive design for web - we don't design for specific screen size - rather we choose a starting layout size and define breakpoints and how our design respond to hitting those breakpoints.</p><p>The basic design process can be outlined in following steps:</p><p><span class="accent">1. Choose a starting point. </span>It's a good practice to research the market and understand what devices your product is used on. For example, if your primary market drivers in NYC - chances are they use the mobile phones vs. tablets which means you should be focused on mdpi-xhdpi screens first.</p><p><span class="accent">2. Design the UX for your main chosen point - screen density, orientation and device type. </span>Make sure the UI is clear and intuitive but it also start thinking about how it's also scalable.</p><p><span class="accent">3. Define breakpoints and layout behavior. </span>Based on a change in a real estate you can adapt your layout and either add more content or break it down into few screens where it makes sense.</p><h3>Common screen sizes</h3><p>Most widely used Android devices and their respective screen sizes are provided in the table below. You should always design with pixel independency in mind.</p><table class="resolutions"><tr class="tbl-header"><td class="device">Device</td><td>Density (ppi)</td><td>Resolution (dp)</td><td>Resolution (px)</td><td>Screen size (inch)</td><td>Aspect ratio</td></tr><tr><td class="device">Samsung Nexus S</td><td>1.5x<span class="type">hdpi</span></td><td>480 x 800 px</td><td>480 x 800 dp</td><td>4.5 in</td><td>16:9</td></tr><tr><td class="device">Samsung Nexus S</td><td>1.5x<span class="type">hdpi</span></td><td>480 x 800 px</td><td>480 x 800 dp</td><td>4.5 in</td><td>16:9</td></tr><tr><td class="device">Samsung Nexus S</td><td>1.5x<span class="type">hdpi</span></td><td>480 x 800 px</td><td>480 x 800 dp</td><td>4.5 in</td><td>16:9</td></tr></table><p>With such a wide variety of screen sizes and densities a good rule of thumb is to design responsively starting at most commonly used device orientation and at normal density and scale up/down appropriately.</p><p>When designing for landscape orientation you might want to get advantage of extra screen width that you have.</p><div class="best-practices"><div class="bp-content"><ul><li><p><span class="accent">Use dp when defining your application UI (instead of pixels). </span>Make sure it scales properly on different screen sizes.</p></li><li><p><span class="accent">Provide alternative bitmap resources for different densities. </span>For example, you should provide higher-resolution bitmaps for high-density screens and the system will use those instead of resizing the bitmap designed for medium-density screens.</p></li></ul></div></div><h2>Standard metrics</h2><p>See table below for standard font sizes and widths used when designing for Android. All sizes are normalized to @1x.</p><table class="resolutions"><tr class="tbl-header"><td class="device">UI component</td><td>Size (pt)</td><td>Weight</td><td>Spacing</td></tr><tr></tr></table><h2>Layout Components</h2><p>Google came up with pretty specific rules on how designer should be treating the layout space. There are a few main points you should take into consideration when designing for Android.</p><div class="article-image"><img src="/images/blog/android-design-guidelines/12.png"></div><h3>Status bar</h3><div class="best-practices purpose"><div class="bp-content"><p><span class="pur-title">Purpose: </span>Used for displaying system notifications, time and battery info.</p></div></div><p>On Android devices user has access to always visible status bar on top of the screen.</p><div class="article-image"><img src="/images/blog/android-design-guidelines/3.png"></div><p>Visually the status bar may or may not be the same color as App bar depending on design considerations. I also find it's a good practice to make it black in certain cases to blend it with the device chrome.</p><p>The status bar can also be translucent.</p><div class="article-image"><img src="/images/blog/android-design-guidelines/15.png"></div>
<h3>App bar</h3><div class="best-practices purpose"><div class="bp-content"><p><span class="pur-title">Purpose: </span>Special kind of toolbar. Used for displaying screen title/filters, navigation and available actions.</p></div></div><p>App bar is used to be called Action bar in the previous versions of Android.</p><p>App bar usually contains navigation elements, titles and actions. All of these are optional and depend on particular screen purpose and content.</p><div class="article-image"><img src="/images/blog/android-design-guidelines/4.png"></div><p class="accent">The default height of App bar is 56dp in portrait and 48dp in landscape.</p><p>The following icons are commonly used in the App bar:</p><div class="article-image"><img src="/images/blog/android-design-guidelines/42.png"></div><p><span class="accent">Menu </span>opens up a side menu.</p><p><span class="accent">Back arrow </span>takes user to the previous screen/acton or cancels the action being performed (exits search functionality).</p><p><span class="accent">Search </span>launches search functionality.</p><p><span class="accent">Overflow menu </span>opens up overflow menu sheet.</p><p><span class="accent">Submit </span>as title suggests it submits the action - sends the message, proceeds to the next step in the flow, etc.</p><p><span class="accent">Refresh </span>updates the current content on the screen with the latest data being displayed.</p><p><span class="accent">Heart </span>bookmarks the current content item - photo, song, url, etc.</p><p><span class="accent">Trash bin </span>performs the delete action.</p><p>... and many others.</p><p>When more than 3 action items are needed to be available in the app bar - they are placed in Overflow menu (see below).</p><div class="best-practices"><div class="bp-content"><ul><li><p><span class="accent">App bar contains the most important actions in the current content </span>that should be immediately available to the user. It's often most basic actions like - menu, navigation and actions important in the current context (send message).</p></li><li><p><span class="accent">Make sure to not clutter the App bar. </span>3-4 icons is more than enough, the rest can be placed in the Overflow menu.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="article-image"><img src="/images/blog/android-design-guidelines/41.png"></div><p>In the App bar all icons and titles should be the same color. If you're using colorful background - usually white color is used for the icons. Make sure you maintain a good contrast between icons/titles and a background.</p><p>App bar can also be extended when you need to provide more space for branding or header image make the App bar more prominent. In this case the App bar height is multiplied by standard height (usually 4 times). Example:</p><div class="article-image"><img src="/images/blog/android-design-guidelines/44.png"></div><p>Example could be the photo folder screen which contains photos grouped by specific criteria (destination).</p><div class="article-image"><img src="/images/blog/android-design-guidelines/48.png"></div><h3>Overflow menu</h3><div class="best-practices purpose"><div class="bp-content"><p><span class="pur-title">Purpose: </span>Used to navigate to additional screens or access secondary actions. Usually hides under three dots icon on the top right.</p></div></div><div class="article-image"><img src="/images/blog/android-design-guidelines/11.png"></div><h3>Search</h3><div class="best-practices purpose"><div class="bp-content"><p><span class="pur-title">Purpose: </span>Specific action that triggers search functionality within current context.</p></div></div><p>There are two search patterns supported by Android UI: persistent and expandable.</p><p><span class="accent">Persistent </span>search is used when search functionality is the main focus of the app. Example: Yelp; user has to search for places (main action) to see places, read reviews, make reservations (following actions).</p><div class="article-image"><img src="/images/blog/android-design-guidelines/29.png"></div><p><span class="accent">Expandable </span>search is used when search isn't the main focus of the app but a nice-to-have functionality that allows users to search for content.</p><div class="article-image"><img src="/images/blog/android-design-guidelines/19.png"></div><p>The magnifying glass icon on the right title is used to implement expandable search pattern. The title transforms into search field blinking cursor and back arrow to exit search. You can optionally include "x" icon to quickly clear the input field. </p><h3>Tabs</h3><div class="best-practices purpose"><div class="bp-content"><p><span class="pur-title">Purpose: </span>Serves for quick navigation and/or as a quick filter for displayed content. Tabs can also be used to change the way content is displayed (table vs list).</p></div></div><p>Tabs represent a clear navigation and provide context for a destination. Besides, the screens available from tabs are only one tap away vs. side nav that we will go over below. It's important to think through clear navigation patterns when designing your application.</p><p>Tabs are used as secondary level navigation as well when you're using side nav as primary navigation (see below).</p><div class="article-image"><img src="/images/blog/android-design-guidelines/49.png"></div><p>Unlike iOS, on Android Tabs are always located on the top of the screen, often attached to the App bar. There are multiple reasons for it, one of them being Navigaion bar located on the bottom - so that two navigation elements do not conflict.</p><div class="article-image"><img src="/images/blog/android-design-guidelines/35.png"></div><p>Tabs can also serve as quick selection filter on the current screen when user needs to switch between similar choices to see different results in the content area.</p><div class="article-image"><img src="/images/blog/android-design-guidelines/33.png"></div><p>Tabs can optionally contain icons.</p><h3>Side nav</h3><div class="best-practices purpose"><div class="bp-content"><p><span class="pur-title">Purpose: </span>As title suggests used mainly for navigation the app. Can also contain info about user identity and help section.</p></div></div><p>Side nav (also known as Navigation Drawer) is a panel that is available by clicking on "hamburger" icon and slides from the left to reveal app navigation.</p><div class="article-image"><img src="/images/blog/android-design-guidelines/47.png"></div><p>Side nav can contain sections for logical distintion between sections within your application.</p><div class="best-practices"><div class="bp-content"><ul><li><p><span class="accent">Side nav is sophisticated way of presenting navigation. </span>However do not overdo it. If you only have a few items to put in the navigation - more persistent pattern might be better. Remember - you job is to minimize the user efforts and eliminate amount of clicks if possible.</p></li></ul></div></div><h3>Bottom bar</h3><div class="best-practices purpose"><div class="bp-content"><p><span class="pur-title">Purpose: </span>Specific type of toolbar that can be utilized for contextual actions, forward actions (Next), etc. Optional.</p></div></div><p>Bottom bar used to be extremely popular in Android design. <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/871796-Telly-Android-Holo-Assets/attachments/93516">Here </a>is an example of how Jeremy Sallee, visual designer at Telly, utilized bottom bar for primary actions.</p><p>Another great use of bottom bar is editing menu.</p><p>However the bottom bar should be used carefully since its location is very close the navigation bar (see below). Consider user's reaction on accidentally navigation back simply because the actions located to close to Navigation bar.</p><h3>Navigation bar</h3><div class="best-practices purpose"><div class="bp-content"><p><span class="pur-title">Purpose: </span>A persistent pattern for Android devices regardless of brand. It contains Back, Overview and Recent actions.</p></div></div><p>You should account for this element in your app design.</p><div class="article-image"><img src="/images/blog/android-design-guidelines/8.png" width="600px"></div><p>Navigation bar can also be translusent or transparent:</p><div class="article-image"><img src="/images/blog/android-design-guidelines/82.png" width="600px"></div><p>The most important takeaway from having the persistent navigation bar is that you should avoid including bottom tab bars as navigation pattern in your application layout. Instead, it is sugested to use top bar or left menu as a way of navigation the app.</p><h3>Content area</h3><div class="best-practices purpose"><div class="bp-content"><p><span class="pur-title">Purpose: </span>Displaying the contextual data as intended by your application.</p></div></div><p>The content area is everything below the App bar and above the bottom bar. The content layout can be in a form of cards, timelines, lists, forms and many others. We'll go over different types of content areas in more details in the following posts.</p><div class="article-image"><img src="/images/blog/android-design-guidelines/14.png"></div><h2>Colors</h2><p>Material Design guidelines from Google suggest using rich and bold colors when designing for Android. The usage of color should be determined by the branding guidelines and overall color atmoshere of the product you're designing for.</p><div class="article-image"><img src="/images/blog/android-design-guidelines/colors.png"></div><h3>Color palette </h3><p>You can refer to Google color palette when choosing colors for your application UI. Google suggests chosing 3 hues from primary palette as main colors and one from secondary palette (starting with A) as an accent color.</p><p>You can download official Google Material Design color swatches <a href="http://material-design.storage.googleapis.com/publish/v_2/material_ext_publish/0B08MbvYZK1iNT0dFWFBjdTNKaXM/color_swatches.zip">here.</a></p><h3>Do I have to follow Material design color scheme?</h3><p>It depends on the project. If you have an establish branding guidelines and color scheme to start off - you should utilize them in the application UI for creating visual consistency with other applications or products under the same brand.</p><p>However if you're starting from scratch having creative freedom - go ahead and create the color scheme using Material colors. They were carefully selected and tested by Google Design team. Using Material design suggested patterns will show that you as respect platform agnostic solutions and strive to minimize the learning curve for your users.</p><p>In any case - whether you follow establish color palletes or not - it is a good rule of thumb to check the color pairing suggestions.</p><h3>Color guide</h3><p>I always include color palette as a part of project style guide with reference for RBG and HEX colors as well as usage guidelines.</p><div class="article-image"><img src="/images/blog/android-design-guidelines/Poosh_StyleGuide.png"></div><h2>Typography</h2><h3>Roboto</h3><p>Standard font used on Android devices is Roboto. You can download it here and use in your application design, it's an open type designed for high density screens.</p><p>Finally, typography uses a slightly finer baseline grid of 4dp, so line heights should be 20dp, 24dp, 32dp, 36dp, etc.</p><div class="article-image"><img src="/images/blog/android-design-guidelines/roboto.png"></div><h3>Roboto Mono</h3><div class="article-image"><img src="/images/blog/android-design-guidelines/45.png"></div><h3>Noto</h3><p>Noto has been the standard typeface on Android for all languages that are not covered by Roboto.</p><div class="article-image"><img src="/images/blog/android-design-guidelines/noto.png"></div><h3>Custom fonts</h3><p>You can include custom fonts into your Android application design to match the branding guidelines. The usage of custom font has to be justified by the need of the app and proven to be the better way of solving design problems that can't be solved with standard fonts offered by Android platform.</p><div class="best-practices"><div class="bp-content"><ul><li><p><span class="accent">Use Roboto for Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic scripts. </span>And Noto for all other languages.</p></li><li><p><span class="accent">Don't use too many text styles and sizes in your app design. </span>It creates inconsistency and confuses the user.</p></li></ul></div></div><h2>Iconography</h2><p>The sharp and recognizable icons are essential part of application UI. Make sure you icons communicating clear intention and get out of the way. It's a good idea to use Android system icons for common actions.</p><div class="article-image"><img src="/images/blog/android-design-guidelines/9.png"></div><p>To make sure you accomodate for different screen sizes and resolutions, follow 2:3:4:6:8 scaling ratio when exporting your icon assets. For low-density screens Android will scale down the assets from HDPI size which is 1/2 of HDPI.</p><div class="article-image"><img src="/images/blog/android-design-guidelines/28.png"></div><h3>Launcher</h3><p>It's the icon on the Home screen, tapping it will launch your application. It has to be sharp and have the level of details enough to recognize the application.</p><div class="best-practices"><div class="bp-content"><ul><li><p><span class="accent">Start designing your icon from mdpi size to make sure it works for smaller screens. </span>Then scale it up to accomodate hdpi, xhdpi, xxhdpi, xxxhdpi.</p></li><li><p><span class="accent">When designing icons use simple lines and recognizable pattertns. </span>See if your icons are recognizable without titles or any other text next to it.</p></li></ul></div></div><h2>Launch screen</h2><div class="article-image"><img src="/images/blog/android-design-guidelines/50.png"></div><h2>Animation</h2><p>Animation is a great subject that goes beyond the scope of this article. We'll cover animation in more details in upcoming Designing Android Animation post.</p><h2>Testing</h2><p>There are a few ways to test your design on Android device. Depending on what software did you use to create the design and what exactly you're testing you can go with:</p><div><div class="col-3"><img src="/images/blog/android-design-guidelines/testing-skala.png"><p> <a href="https://bjango.com/help/skalaviewandroid/overview/" target="_blank">Skala View </a>lets you preview design directly from Photoshop. You need to establish connection between PS and Android device over the same wi-fi.</p></div><div class="col-3"><img src="/images/blog/android-design-guidelines/testing-invision.png"><p>You can setup a simple flow in <a href="https://bjango.com/help/skalaviewandroid/overview/" target="_blank">Invision</a>. Useful for user testing on earlier stages of the project.</p></div><div class="col-3"><img src="/images/blog/android-design-guidelines/testing-pixate.png"><p>In case you have built an interactive prototype - you can view in on actual device by installing <a href="https://bjango.com/help/skalaviewandroid/overview/" target="_blank">Pixate </a>on your Android device.</p></div></div><h2>Resources</h2><p>Refer to the resources below for more in-depth explanation of principles of Android design.
